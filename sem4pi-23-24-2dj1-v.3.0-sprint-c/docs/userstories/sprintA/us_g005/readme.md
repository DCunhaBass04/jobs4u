# US G005

## 1. Context

* This US was assigned during the first **Sprint** as part of its setup process.

## 2. Requirements

**US G005** As Project Manager, I want the team to add to the project the necessary scripts, so that build/executions/deployments/... can be executed effortlessly

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- G005.1. The user should be able to build the project (and its tests) and run each module without using an IDE

**Dependencies/References:**

* Include scripts for all the major tasks and execution of applications

## 3. Analysis

* The team created a script for:
  * Each of the project's modules,
  * Building and testing.
    * These are automatically executed when doing a *git commit* (covered in [G004](../us_g004))

## 4. Design

* Design is not applicable to this US.

## 5. Implementation

* Implementation is not applicable to this US.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

* Integration/Demonstration is not applicable to this US.

## 7. Observations

* The team used the scripts in **EAPLI's repository** as a basis for our scripts.
