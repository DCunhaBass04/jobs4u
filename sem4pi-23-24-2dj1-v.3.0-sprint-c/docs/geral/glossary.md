# Glossary

This document includes the glossary with the terms important to the project's business.

This is a live document, so it'll be constantly updated in the middle of a *Sprint* and in between *Sprints*.

For the sake of organization , our group decided to sort the following list of  Terms by its  aggregate's prefixes:

**CA:** Candidate

**C:** Customer

**JA:** JobApplication

**JO** JobOpening

**JR:** JobRequirements

**IM:** InterviewModel:

**Note:** Each term without any prefix is assumed not be part of any aggregate and therefore be a **Service**.
